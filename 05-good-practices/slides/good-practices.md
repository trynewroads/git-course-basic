# Buenas Pr√°cticas

## Flujos de Trabajo en Git

---

### ¬øPor qu√© necesitamos flujos de trabajo?

Sin un flujo definido, los equipos enfrentan:
- **Conflictos constantes** entre desarrolladores
- **C√≥digo inestable** en ramas principales
- **Releases ca√≥ticas** sin control
- **Falta de trazabilidad** de cambios


---

Un flujo de trabajo define **c√≥mo y cu√°ndo** se integran los cambios. No hay una estrategia perfecta, simplemente se usa la que mejor se adapte al proyecto:

- Git Flow

- Github flow

- GitLab flow

- Trunk Based

- Shop/Shop/Ask

---


## Git Flow

El flujo m√°s tradicional y estructurado para equipos grandes.

**Ramas principales:**
- `main`: C√≥digo en producci√≥n (estable)
- `develop`: Rama de desarrollo principal

**Ramas de soporte:**
- `feature/*`: Nuevas funcionalidades
- `release/*`: Preparaci√≥n de releases
- `hotfix/*`: Correcciones urgentes

---

### Git Flow - Caracter√≠sticas

**Ventajas:**
- Control total sobre releases
- Historial muy organizado
- Ideal para software con versiones

**Desventajas:**
- Muy complejo para equipos peque√±os
- Releases lentos
- Muchas ramas que mantener


---
### Git Flow - Flujo Feature

```bash
# Crear feature desde develop
git switch -c develop
git switch -b feature/login

# Desarrollo y commits
git commit -m "feat: add login form"
git commit -m "feat: add validation"

# Merge a develop
git switch develop
git merge feature/login-usuario
```

---

## GitHub Flow

El flujo m√°s simple y directo para desarrollo continuo.

**Rama principal:**
- `main`: Siempre desplegable y estable

**Ramas de trabajo:**
- `feature/*`: Nuevas funcionalidades
- `bugfix/*`: Correcci√≥n de errores
- `hotfix/*`: Correcciones urgentes

**Principio:** Todo sale y entra de `main`

---

### GitHub Flow - Caracter√≠sticas

**Ventajas:**
- Muy simple de entender y aplicar
- Deploy continuo natural
- Ideal para equipos √°giles
- Menos overhead de gesti√≥n

**Desventajas:**
- Requiere CI/CD robusto
- `main` debe estar siempre estable
- No ideal para releases planificados

---

### GitHub Flow - Flujo b√°sico

```bash
# Crear feature desde main
git switch main
git pull origin main
git switch -c feature/user-profile

# Desarrollo
git commit -m "feat: add user profile page"
git push -u origin feature/user-profile

# PR ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí Deploy
```

</div>

---

## Trunk-based Development

Un tronco principal donde todos integran frecuentemente.

**Rama principal:**
- `main` o `trunk`: √önica rama principal

**Ramas de trabajo:**
- Muy cortas (< 1 d√≠a) o commits directos
- `hotfix/*`: Solo para correcciones urgentes

**Principio:** Integraci√≥n continua real

---

### Trunk-based - Caracter√≠sticas

**Ventajas:**
- Integraci√≥n continua real
- Sin merge hell
- Deploy frecuente y r√°pido
- Feedback inmediato

**Desventajas:**
- Requiere desarrolladores senior
- CI/CD muy robusto obligatorio
- Feature flags necesarios
- Tests autom√°ticos cr√≠ticos

---

### Trunk-based - Flujo b√°sico

```bash
# Actualizar trunk frecuentemente
git switch main
git pull origin main

# Cambios peque√±os directos
git commit -m "feat: add button component"
git push origin main

# O ramas ultra-cortas
git switch -c quick-fix
git commit -m "fix: button alignment"
git push origin quick-fix
# PR inmediato ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí Delete
```

## Ship/Show/Ask

Estrategia que combina autonom√≠a con colaboraci√≥n seg√∫n el tipo de cambio.

- **Ship** üö¢: Cambios que puedes hacer directamente

- **Show** üëÅÔ∏è: Cambios que compartes para feedback

- **Ask** ‚ùì: Cambios que requieren discusi√≥n previa

- **Principio:** Balance entre velocidad y control

---

### Ship/Show/Ask - Caracter√≠sticas

**Ventajas:**
- Autonom√≠a para desarrolladores senior
- Velocidad en cambios menores
- Control en cambios cr√≠ticos
- Cultura de confianza en el equipo

**Desventajas:**
- Requiere criterio maduro del equipo
- Necesita desarrolladores experimentados
- Puede crear inconsistencias si no hay criterio
- Dif√≠cil para equipos nuevos

---

### Ship/Show/Ask - Criterios

---

**Ship (Push directo):**
- Typos en documentaci√≥n
- Tests adicionales
- Refactoring menor
- Actualizaciones de dependencias

---

**Show (PR sin esperar aprobaci√≥n):**
- Features peque√±as
- Cambios de UI menores
- Optimizaciones de rendimiento

---

**Ask (PR con revisi√≥n obligatoria):**
- Cambios de arquitectura
- APIs p√∫blicas
- Features complejas
- Cambios de seguridad

---

### Ship/Show/Ask - Flujo

```bash
# SHIP - Fix documentaci√≥n
git commit -m "docs: fix typo in README"
git push origin main

# SHOW - Feature peque√±a
git switch -c small-feature
git push -u origin small-feature
# Create PR ‚Üí Optional review ‚Üí Merge

# ASK - Cambio grande
git switch -c big-change
# Discutir primero ‚Üí PR ‚Üí Required review
```
